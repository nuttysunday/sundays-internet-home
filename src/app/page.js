        <p>Currently exploring shell scripting, docker watchtower and git pre-commit hooks! Scared of bad guys :(, therefore using google compute engine.</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom:'2rem'}}>Hi, I'm Shivam—yet another software engineer, currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at NC State University, North Carolina. I’ve got a 3.6/4 GPA, and some of my favorite classes include Databases, Cloud Computing, Software Engineering, and Computer Networks. I’m set to graduate in May 2025—unless I mess up something along the way.</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom:'2rem'}}>Before this, I wrapped up my undergrad in May 2023 from Mumbai University with an 8.6/10 GPA. I took courses like Web Development, Algorithms, and DevOps, with projects mainly revolving around Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom:'2rem'}}>These days, I’m all about Full Stack Development, currently exploring NextJS & TailwindCSS. I'am also self-hosting web apps on Raspberry Pi, using Cloudflare and Docker. Along the way, I’ve picked up some skills in wifi network security, remote desktop/SSH setups, firewall configurations, and OpenVPN and SMTP protocols with ImprovMX for mail forwarding.</p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom:'2rem'}}>I love exploring random new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest in the computer world.</p>
