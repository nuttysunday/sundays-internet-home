This is my biggest money earned at that point, (around 200 bucks for 10 hours of work). This was super motivating for me. It is acutally based on the research paper, Protocol Based Deep Intrusion Detection for DoS Normal and DDoS Attacks. So what i did was collected the data, map the parameters [trust me it was difficult], process the data, and clean it. Trained a neural network (LSTM) using Tensorflow of the notion of upsampling, because the data was highly imbalance.
